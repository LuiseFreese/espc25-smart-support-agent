- **Billing**: Payment issues, refunds, invoice questions, subscription changes
- **Account**: Password resets, profile updates, account settings
- **Access**: Permission requests, role changes, resource access

Priority rules:
- **High**: Outages, security issues, data loss, blocking work for multiple users
- **Medium**: Degraded performance, individual user blocked, workaround available
